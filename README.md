# Portfolio

## Description

Personal portfolio website describing my skills and education. Also features some projects I've coded through freeCodeCamp certifications and my own independent work.

## History/Motivation

I had long been interested in creating a personal website to host some projects and information about myself. I first attempted to create a site in 2020 during the pandemic. My next attempt was working through freeCodeCamp's *Responsive Web Design* certification.

After obtaining the AWS Certified Cloud Practicioner certification in August 2023, I decided to use my new skills to host my website in an S3 bucket. It was my first time successfully purchasing a domain and actually being able to find my personal site on the Internet, instead of looking at my work in a container or code editor.

In August 2024, I switched hosting my website from AWS to GitHub Pages.

## Future Plans/Things I Want to Improve

- From my own observation and feedback from others, I know my site is simple and well-organized, but bland. I want to figure out a way to make the site more visually appealing.
- I'd also like to refactor the "My Work" page, as I'm no longer a fan of the carousels.
- Since I still have access to a domain, I want to figure out how to replace the standard GitHub Pages URL for my custom domain name
